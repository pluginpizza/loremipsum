Insert placeholder text or images via autocompletion.

== Description ==

The Lorem Ipsum plugin allows users to quickly insert placeholder text into their WordPress posts and pages via autocompletion. By simply typing 'lorem' in the block editor, users can open an autocompletion options modal to easily add lorem ipsum text or a placeholder image.

To use Lorem Ipsum, there are only two things you need to do: install and activate the plugin. An autocompleter to insert placeholder text and images becomes available in the block editor without any extra configuration. Lorem Ipsum also works great as a [must-use plugin](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/must-use-plugins/).

1. Type 'lorem' in the editor.
1. An autocompletion options modal will appear.
